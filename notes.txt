Problem calculates are not constant
- data print out constant as expected
--> problem resolved: num_iter should have been initialised <--

TODO:
- flow: update for data & flow_curr/flow_prev to use the same type of array
- flow: write correct csv file (?)
- validation tests
- flow: allow user to define which file to run on
- flow: improve the filter algorithm
- flow: turn it into OOP w/ functions
- flow: make consitent data structures
- flow: calculate velocity correctly
- flow: calculate flow correctly (?)
- data_plot: include variance plots (uncertanity)
- data_gen: tidy up, comment
- flow: why does calculation change every time flow is ran?
