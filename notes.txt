- data print out constant as expected
--> problem resolved I had not initialised num_iter

TODO:
- update for data & flow_curr/flow_prev to use the same type of array
- write correct csv file
- validation tests
- data_plot: plot results with matplot lib
- flow: allow user to define which file to run on
