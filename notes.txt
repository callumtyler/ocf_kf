Problem calculates are not constant
- data print out constant as expected
--> problem resolved: num_iter should have been initialised <--

Problem two different runs of flow return different results
--> Problem resolved: appeared to be a problem w/ reading from array <--

TODO:
- flow: write correct csv file (?)
- validation tests
- flow: allow user to define which file to run on
- flow: add extra filter algorithms
- data_gen: user input for channel characteristics
- flow: calculate flow correctly (?)
- data_plot: include variance plots (uncertanity)
- data_plot: increase lengend font
- flow: implement different filters and output different results for plotting
- README: provide detailed theory explanation, stating assumptions

Commands:
	python3 data_gen.py
	./flow
	python3 data_plot.py ocf_meas.csv ocf_prev.csv ocf_curr.csv ocf_data.csv

Assumptions:
- all data is coming in at once
- all data has the same timestamp (in reality it would not)
